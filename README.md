# My personal Website
This is just the "my personal site". Nothing special. This is the ultra-mini stack that I've used:  
 - html for content
 - [BeerCSS](https://www.beercss.com) via CDN for style
 - [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com) via CDN and
 - [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/search?o=r&m=free) via CDN for icons.
